# Analysis workflows developped or supported by BiBs

## [RNA-seq by RASflow_EDC](/bibs/edctools/workflows/rasflow_edc/#/edctools)  
  Implemented by BiBs, this workflow for RNA-seq data analysis is based on RASflow which was originally published by [X. Zhang](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3433-x). It has been modified to run effectively on both IFB and iPOP-UP core cluster and to fit our specific needs. Moreover, several tools and features were added, including a comprehensive report, as well as the possibility to incorporate the repeats in the analysis. 

## [nf-cores worflows](/bibs/edctools/workflows/nf-cores/#/edctools)  
  Curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow. They can run on both [IFB-core](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/cluster-ifb-core/) and [iPOP-UP](https://ipop-up.docs.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/documentation/) clusters.
