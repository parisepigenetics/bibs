## Documentation 
A [complete documentation](https://ipop-up.docs.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/documentation/) is currently under construction. For now you can refer to the [IFB core cluster documentation](https://ifb-elixirfr.gitlab.io/cluster/doc/) as the iPOP-UP cluster is very similar and uses Slurm as well. 

The slides of the training we gave in November 2022 are [available here]({{site.baseurl}}/documents/Cluster_formation_iPOP_UP.pdf), as well as [exemplary sbatch scripts]({{site.baseurl}}/documents/corrections.zip) as corrections of the exercices.  

Below are the specificities of the iPOP-UP cluster.

## Ask for an account and a project

If you had an account on the "old" RPBS cluster, your login and password are unchanged. Otherwise we'll create a new account for you. In any case you have to ask for a project. 

<span>{% include icon.liquid id='info-circle' %} <b>Info</b></span><br>You can have several projects.<br>You can share a project between several collaborators. All collaborators will have the read and write permissions on the project.
{: .ui.info.message}

To create an account and/or a project, write an email to [BiBs](mailto:bibsATparisepigenetics.com) with the following information: 
- NAME, Surname 
- Unit
- Email (institutional adress)
- Projet name (acronym) 
- Required disk space (an estimation) 
- Data type  
- [Facultative] Username of collaborators for this project

We'll create your account and/or project in the following hours/days. Once your account is ready, you'll receive an email with your password.

## Connect to iPOP-UP cluster

Server : **ipop-up.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr**

 You can connect to iPOP-UP server only via `ssh` for now. To do so, use your terminal and type the following command replacing `username` by your iPOP-UP username (last name in lower case usually). 

```bash
You@YourComputer:~/PathTo/RNAseqProject$ ssh username@ipop-up.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr
```

You will have to enter your password and then you'll be connected. 

<span>{% include icon.liquid id='lightbulb-outline' %} <b>Tip</b></span><br> Once connected, you can change your password using the `passwd` command.

Bienvenue sur le cluster iPOP-UP.

Pour toute question ou demande de support, rejoignez-nous sur le forum de RPBS : https://discourse.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr

Pour changer le compte projet par d√©faut : sacctmgr update user $USER set defaultaccount=<project-name>

Once your project is created you will see it in the list, with the used and available disk space. You can access it at `/shared/projects/YourProjectName` using the `cd` command.

```
[username@ipop-up ~]$ cd /shared/projects/YourProjectName
```
<span>{% include icon.liquid id='lightbulb-outline' %} <b>Tip</b></span><br> In order to navigate easily in your files with your regular file manager, you can mount your project folder as a disk on your local system. Please follow the instructions for [Windows]({{site.baseurl}}/cluster/tips/mounting_win) or [Linux]({{site.baseurl}}/cluster/tips/mounting_linux). This way, you can modify your files directly using any local text editor.

## Launch jobs

The scheduler is [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/). You'll find some examples of scripts in [IFB cluster quick start guide](https://ifb-elixirfr.gitlab.io/cluster/doc/quick-start/).  

The only difference is that you have to use the `ipop-up` partition when starting a job. You can define it using `srun` : 
```
srun -p ipop-up my_commande 
```
or  `sbatch` : 

```
sbatch -p ipop-up my_sbatch_script.sh
```

or directly in your sbatch script adding the line : 

```sh
#SBATCH --partition=ipop-up
```

## Where to find reference genomes and annotations?

In order to avoid having dozens of copies of the human or mouse genome on the cluster, shared reference files are available in `/shared/banks`. This folder contains :
- reference genome FASTA files
- aligner (STAR, HISAT2, BWA, ...) indexes
- annotation (GTF, GFF) files, ... 

Before running your analysis, please check if your reference is available in `shared/banks`. If not, let us know what you need [by email](mailto:bibsATparisepigenetics.com) or on the [community forum](https://discourse.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/c/ipop-up/) and we'll add it quickly.
